		<h2>Step 1: Retrieving Your Birth Certificate</h2>
		<p style="float: left;"><img src="../images/birthcertificate.png" height="310px" width="500px" ></p>

		<h3>Option 1: Asking a family member for help</h3>

		<p>
			Birth Certificates can be obtained in person in the county you were born in, or remotely by mail / on the Internet.
			In order to retrieve your birth certificate, you must show a photo ID.
			Because of this, it cam be easier to have a close family member get your birth certificate, as they ecause family member can use their own ID to get it on your behalf.
			Examples of close family members include:</br></br>

		• Parents</br>
		• Legal Guardians</br>
		• Children</br>
		• Grandparents</br>
		• Grandchildren</br>
		• Siblings</br>
		• Spouses</br>
		• Domestic Partners</p>

		<p>
			If you have any of these family members, we STRONGLY recommend asking them to help you obtain your birth certificate.
		</p>

		<h3>Option 2: Retrieving the Certificate Yourself</h3>

		<p> You can either retrieve your birth certificate in person or by filling out a form.</p>

	<p>If you decide to get your birth certificate in person, you will need a notory to verify your identity with the ID
			you have on hand, such as CDCR (prison or parole ID) ID, public benefits cards, or witnesses confirming your identity.

			If you do not have local contacts to confirm your identity, you can ask your parole or probation officer
			(and their supervisor or other colleague, if you need a second person) to confirm your identity.
		</p>

		<p> Below, you can find the resources necessary to fill out the form to obtain your birth certificate. Each county in California has its own form to use in person,
			whereas the state of California only has one form. This form is shown below.</p>

		<a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/CDPH%20Document%20Library/ControlledForms/VS111.pdf" style="float: left;"><nobr> Mail in CA Forms are available here.</a><br>

		<p>It costs $25 for a mail-in California form, while each county's form has its own cost. If you are homeless, you can fill out the following form for a fee waiver.
			Please note that this form must be signed by a homeless service provider. This includes transitional housing providers. Catholic Charities, parole, and probation may also be able to provide signed fee waivers.

		<h2>Step 2: Obtaining Your Social Security Card</h2>

		<p> If you are requesting a replacement social security card (because they have a number), then you can request it by mail (or online, if you have a state issued ID/DL and are not changing your name).
			New social security cards must be obtained in person at your local Social Security Office. </br>

			You must have the following items if when you go to the office: </br> </br>
			• Proof of citizenship (birth certificate or passport) </br>
			• Proof of age (religious record made before the age of 5 showing your date of birth, US hospital record of your birth, or passport) </br>
			• Proof of identity (MediCal card, U.S. military ID, certificate of naturalization, health insurance card, certified copy of medical record, or student ID/record)
