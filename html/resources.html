		<h2>Step 1: Retrieving Your Birth Certificate</h2>

		<h3>Option 1: Asking a family member for help</h3>

		<p>
			Birth Certificates can be obtained in person in the county you were born in, or remotely by mail / on the Internet.
			In order to retrieve your birth certificate, you must show a photo ID.
			Because of this, it cam be easier to have a close family member get your birth certificate, as they ecause family member can use their own ID to get it on your behalf.
		</p>

		<p>Examples of close family members include:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>Parents</li>
		<li>Legal Guardians</li>
		<li>Children</li>
		<li>Grandparents</li>
		<li>Grandchildren</li>
		<li>Siblings</li>
		<li>Spouses</li>
		<li>Domestic Partners</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			If you have any of these family members, we STRONGLY recommend asking them to help you obtain your birth certificate.
		</p>

		<h3>Option 2: Retrieving the Certificate Yourself</h3>

		<p>
			There are two routes you can take when retrieving your birth certificate on your own: 1) going in person, or 2) filling out a form.
		</p>

		<h4>In Person</h4>

		<p>If you have to get your birth certificate by yourself, you will need a notory to verify your identity with the ID
			you have on hand, such as CDCR (prison or parole ID) ID, public benefits cards, or witnesses confirming your identity.

			If you do not have local contacts to confirm your identity, you can ask your parole or probation officer
			(and their supervisor or other colleague, if you need a second person) to confirm your identity.
