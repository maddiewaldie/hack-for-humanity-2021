		<h2>Step 1: Retrieving Your Birth Certificate</h2>

		<h3>Option 1: Asking a family member for help</h3>

		<p>
			Birth Certificates can be obtained in person in the county you were born in, or remotely by mail / on the Internet.
			In order to retrieve your birth certificate, you must show a photo ID.
			Because of this, it cam be easier to have a close family member get your birth certificate, as they ecause family member can use their own ID to get it on your behalf.
		</p>

		<p>Examples of close family members include:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>Parents</li>
		<li>Legal Guardians</li>
		<li>Children</li>
		<li>Grandparents</li>
		<li>Grandchildren</li>
		<li>Siblings</li>
		<li>Spouses</li>
		<li>Domestic Partners</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			If you have any of these family members, we STRONGLY recommend asking them to help you obtain your birth certificate.
		</p>

		<h3>Option 2: Retrieving the Certificate Yourself</h3>

		<p>
			There are two routes you can take when retrieving your birth certificate on your own: 1) going in person, or 2) filling out a form.
		</p>

		<h4>In Person</h4>

		

		<p>
			If they must get documents by themselves, then the person will need to find a notary who will verify their
			identity with the ID they have on hand, such as CDCR (prison or parole ID) ID, public benefits cards, or
			witnesses confirming their identity.

			Tip: If a person does not have local contacts to confirm identity, the person can ask parole or probation officer
			(and their supervisor or other colleague, if they need a second person) to confirm their identity
