# Hack for Humanity 2021

## About the Project

People released from prison face a lot of obstacles due to their conviction history and incarceration. One obstacle upon release is getting necessary identification. Identification is essential for almost everything, including housing, employment, banking, getting a motel/hotel room, getting public benefits, and receiving medical care. Yet, people are often released from prison without a photo ID and commonly no longer have access to their social security card and birth certificate. And the process for getting each of these documents is complicated.

This website aims to make previously incarcerated people's integration into society easier. Keep reading to find more about the site's capabilities!


## A Tour of the Site


### ID Resources

The ID resources tab of our website provides a comprehensive guide on how to go about obtaining (or renewing) your IDs. From step by step instructions, to lists of required identification materials, to maps, this section of the website has it all!

### Job Search

As stated above, many former prisoners experience difficulty finding a job after release. During their time spent in prison, many lose work skills and are given little opportunity to gain useful work experience. Moreover, the availability of job-training programs in prison has declined in recent years.

The job search tab of our website is designed to help people who were formerly incarcerated find jobs. Upon entering their location, this tab allows the user to find resources in their area that can help with employment.
