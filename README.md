### Job Search

Most former prisoners experience difficulty finding a job after release. During their time spent in prison, many lose work skills and are given little opportunity to gain useful work experience. Moreover, the availability of job-training programs in prison has declined in recent years.

The job search feature of our website is designed to help people who were formerly incarcerated find jobs. Upon entering their location, this tab allows the user to find resources in their area that can help with employment.
